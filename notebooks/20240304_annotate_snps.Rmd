The goal of this script is to develop code to filter the annotation file to include only markers listed in a `.bim` file from plink.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
``````
Load the test annotation file

```{r}
ct_anno_data_file <- "~/Desktop/ben_1_ortholog_variation/annotation/c_tropicalis/WI.20230305.strain-annotation.tsv"
```
