These orthogroup data were generated by Nic's GMVK shiny app and contain all orthogroup data. 

The file `masterOrthoDB.tsv` has the orthogroup data. The file has four columns.

```
og_data_raw <- data.table::fread(
    "masterOrthoDB.tsv",
    col.names = c("OG", "longest_iso"),
    )
```
```
> names(og_data_raw)
[1] "Orthogroup"                                            
[2] "Curation-VF-230214.PC.clean.renamed.csq.longest.prot"  
[3] "NIC58.longest.prot"                                    
[4] "c_elegans.PRJNA13758.WS279.protein_coding.longest.prot"
```

The Orthogroup column has the orthogroup ID and each column contains a comma seperated list of isoforms ex) 

`3: Transcript_B0294.3.1, Transcript_C17B7.11.1,`

The file `masterOrthoDB_wAlias.tsv` has the alis columns added for each species.

```
> names(og_data)
[1] "Orthogroup" "WB_id"      "WB_alias"   "seqname"    "N2"        
[6] "QX1410"     "NIC58"    
```
